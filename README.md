DFT-FE : Density Functional Theory With Finite-Elements 
=======================================================


About
-----

DFT-FE is a C++ code for material modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
It is based on adaptive finite-element based methodologies and handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the 
same framework while accomodating arbitrary boundary conditions. DFT-FE code builds on top of the deal.II library for everything 
that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling.
