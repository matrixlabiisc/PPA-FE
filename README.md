DFT-FE : Density Functional Theory With Finite-Elements 
=======================================================


About
-----

DFT-FE is a C++ code for material modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
It is based on adaptive finite-element based methodologies and handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the 
same framework while accomodating arbitrary boundary conditions. DFT-FE code builds on top of the deal.II library for everything 
that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling. 


Installation instructions
