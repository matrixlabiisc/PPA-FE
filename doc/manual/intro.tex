DFT-FE is a C++ code for material modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
It is based on adaptive finite-element based methodologies and handles all-electron and pseudopotential calculations in the 
same framework while accommodating arbitrary boundary conditions. dft-fe code builds on top of the deal.II library for everything 
that has to do with finite elements, geometries, meshes, etc., and, through deal.II on p4est for parallel adaptive mesh handling.

\subsection{Authors}
\label{sec:authors}
\dftfe{} is hosted by the \href{http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vikramg/}{Computational Materials Physics
group at University of Michigan}, with Vikram Gavini, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering, as
the principal investigator broadly overseeing this effort. The code is maintained by a group of principal developers, 
who manage the architecture of the code and the core functionalities. Developers with
significant contributions to core functionalities and code architecture in the past who are 
no longer active principal developers, are listed under principal developers emeriti. 
A subset of the principal developers and mentors are administrators. Finally, all contributors who have
contributed major parts of the DFT-FE code or sent fixes and small enhancements are listed
under contributors. All the underlying lists are in alphabetical order.
